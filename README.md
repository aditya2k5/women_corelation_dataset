# Analyzing Child Marriage in India Through
  prediction of percentage of women who are getting married before age of 18 years in india when main input is given as percentage of Women's litracy rate Using Machine Learning
# Why This Project
 Literacy among women and child marriage are still very vital
 issues that hinder India’s social, economic, and health growth. However,
 there is a shortage in analytic and predictive models and international
 commitments to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As of Cen
sus 2011, only 65.5 percentage of women are literate compared to 82.1
 percentage of men, with agricultural and rural women being kept from
 education. This problem causes women’s illiteracy to rise and weakens
 national and economic advancement. India is home to almost one-third
 of child brides, with estimates around 1.5 million girls getting married
 before they turn 18. This early marriage escalates risks ranging from
 maternal and infant mortality to premature malnutrition, infant death,
 and physical and psychological harm . Although states like Assam and
 Karnataka have introduced enforcement measures, the prevention gaps
 remain a significant challenge. This study explores the nationwide conse
quences of child marriage on women. Illiteracy in child marriage through
 correlational methods. Using publicly available socio-demographic infor
mation and machine learning techniques, the study reveals trends be
tween literacy rates among women and child marriage rates, demon
strating how predictive analysis can assist policymakers in developing
 targeted, data-informed interventions. The results place education not
 merely as a human right, but as an instrumental driver for eliminating
 child marriage, protecting adolescent health, enhancing gender equality,
 and accelerating country growth. Rising female literacy actually prevents
 child marriage, facilitates gender equality, and enables healthier adoles
cent growth. The MLP model, with a test R² of 0.94 and MAE of 0.53,
 delivers highly precise forecasts that enable policymakers to proactively
 identify and support high-risk communities. Using advanced predictive
 analytics ensures interventions are targeted for meaningful, long-term
 social improvement
# Dataset Description

 the official government repository data.gov.in. It encompasses socio-demographic
 features organized by districts and States/Union Territories (UT) for the period
 2019–2021.
